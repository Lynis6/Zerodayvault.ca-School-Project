This is 3 screenshots of the web application project I completed, keeping in mind this was all done without the use of a web application tool through HTML and CSS, all of the pictures on the sides of the blog 
are clickable links that will direct you to the new article or cyber security website tool for learning. I believe I had put on the right haand side all relative to that time news articles and on the left hand 
side was links to learning tools and places people could go to help guide there interest in the ever evolving world of cybersecurity.
